Tim is my name. I'm currently doing my master in computer science and live in Germany. I mostly work with Java-based backend services, but do work up and down the stack. In my free time I work on different kinds of projects but generally some that make my life easier. Occasionally I like to play games and am interested in esports, IT-security and open source.
